4/7/2023 11:54:44,Nick Smith,Yes,"No. Police should adopt a de-centralized model and have small ""micro stations"" neighborhood-to-neighborhood with 2-3 cops each. Most crime would be deterred simply by them walking the block throughout the day. Plus it probably would help stop this whole ""us versus them"" mentality that has been occurring within the police themselves and among the public. 

Crazy idea, I know, but maybe test a pilot program?","most of the places where small business would want to establish themselves are in significant need for cleaning/garbage pick-up. The more successful areas where there is a high density of small businesses have less garbage on the sidewalks (e.g., Allen St. vs. Elmwood or Hertle). Quite simply, people don't want to walk their dogs and bring their kids around broken glass and garbage. 

Would be nice to maybe provide tax break perhaps to small business that commit to cleaning the area right outside their property. Also, a monthly highlight of small businesses would always be welcomed. ","Reduce Expenses: Commit to drastic contract re-negotiations to limit overtime. I'm a salaried state employee myself, so I get the desire to push OT in order to pad retirements, however, this strategy ultimately harms tax payers as hourly individuals will typically work drastic and unrealistic OT schedules just to artificially inflate their retirement, which then becomes a permanent expense to the city, even after the employee leaves the area. 

Reduce Expense: switch from rock salt to saline solutions which have been shown to be more effective and less costly at keeping roads ice-free

Reduce Expense: Personal (and probably a bit controversial) opinion, but don't really see the need for local police to purchase military-grade hardware. Kinda overkill and frankly do not have the training of the military so seems risky, too. 

Increase revenue: increase tax on local marinas. Buffalo has a large number of marinas (I know because I was just looking to buy a boat last year), which are very cost-competitive for rent, meaning there is a little bit of room to increase tax. Plus, if I can afford a boat, I can afford a slight increase in marina fees to support the local economy. 

Increase revenue: offer the city's expansive snow removal workforce for purchase, which can help subsidize and make snow removal more self-sufficient. 


","1. grants for cooperative housing and grocery stores. Would be nice (especially on the east side) for renovated homes and apartments to be rented as cooperatives that are community owned. This can limit costs, reduce rent, and help prevent entities without ties to Buffalo from further leveraging the Buffalo housing market in a way that harms local residents

2. Parental involvement in childhood education is one of the best predictors of success. Obviously, with many children not having control over that, it can leave many without a reliable support structure. Would be nice to have a ""big brother/big sister""-type of program that links Buffalo City School students with individuals who can aid in providing some structure. 

3. If replacing the sky way becomes an actual thing, a pedestrian bridge from inner to outer harbor would significantly increase utilization of the space. The ferry currently is good, but the bridge would be available 24/7, plus, given Buffalo's affinity for alcohol-fueled events, would provide an option for people to walk to the train and reduce potential DUI issues when there is an event at the outer harbor. 

4. Would be nice to see more on-the-job training opportunities, especially if linked with local universities and colleges. E.G. I run a research lab and would eagerly take on someone to train as a technician (even if the person doesn't have experience), but typically limited by funding which makes it too high-risk to hire someone without some baseline experience.

Incentivizing community based housing and grocery cooperatives

Improve police integration with *neighborhoods*; placing police in a silo among the current 5 precincts is only re-inforcing the current policing status quo, which is clearly not working. Police are an important and integral part of the community, and to re-build trust they need to start appearing to be part of the community. If every interaction a person has with police is only negative, its going to continue to perpetuate this ""us-versus-them"" mentality. ","Well a fully staffed ethics board would be a nice start seeing as that is still completely unaddressed.

Law enforcement seems to lack the resources to respond to quality of life issues that do not involve potential lethality. These 'lesser crimes' are those that drive people out of the city.,"I don't have enough information to offer an informed response about that currently.  I have read that when other communities across the country have addressed poverty, improved community streets/sidewalks, youth programming, (for example) in low income areas, crime has subsided.  Supporting small businesses in these areas is critical.  People in low income neighborhoods lack hope.  Support and highlight small business start ups, involve community members in decisions, engage with youth groups, clean up streets so that businesses are able to attract community members and those outside the immediate community.  

","Support endeavors that make Buffalo a destination.  Riverworks, Canalside, concerts, etc. ","All of these services are critical, but kids and their families need hope. It's like putting the hospital at the bottom of the cliff to solve the problem of kids falling off the cliff.

We have removed consequences from people's actions and then act surprised when they break the law,Reducing crime and reducing the outrageous taxes of New York State would do wonders to attract more business to the city,The city should look into its own EMS department with ambulance transport. The revenue from transport fees would bring in a lot of revenue for the city,"We need to support organizations that help keep families together. We have incentivized single parent households for too long and we are seeing the ramifications of that both socially, economically, and culturally. Schools should be full of electives such as art, music, sports, trades (electrician, construction, etc). Not every kid needs to waste their money to go to college when they may find a well paying job in a field they enjoy without that typically useless degree.

4/7/2023 15:26:32,Alan Romano,Yes,"No, I feel that more can be done to ensure safety for everyone. In particular, I feel most at risk when walking as many reckless drivers will ignore stop signs, fail to yield the right of way, and drive way above the speed limit. More should be done to enforce that these rules are followed, either through active traffic monitoring or passively by improved street designs.","I do not think the city is doing enough. The city should provide more support to those seeking to start small business. In particular, the city should do more to ensure that new small businesses owners coming from and intending to serve neighborhoods that lack activity have help to either rent or purchase properties in these areas. There are many properties that are abandoned, neglected, or vacant in some Buffalo neighborhoods, so the city should take a stronger, more active approach in penalizing landlords that sit on these neglected properties to open them up for active usage.","Building on the previous points, the city could increase taxes on property owners who sit on neglected properties, as this would also incentivize them to actively utilize their properties. In addition, the city should reallocate funds for law enforcement into alternative social programs that can support the people and build a stronger labor force. These programs should reduce the need for law enforcement by directly tackling the issues that drive people into committing crimes.","The budget should absolutely fund programs that support individuals and their families, such as mental health services,  after school programs, , senior citizen programs,  and community building, as these programs can ensure healthy family life. The city should also fund programs that support job training programs for modern industries, such as technology, urban agriculture, etc..., to ensure that Buffalo has a strong and competitive labor market.

Current budget practices employed by the city favor short-term savings over long-term increases in maintenance debt. Growing research has shown that the adoption of community-focused urban policies leads to more value per dollar spent than other practices focused on reduced city spending on social services.,"The city could adopt more policies to ensure that budget information and other city decisions are easily accessible to promote transparency. The city could improve engagement by improving its online presence when seeking input from the public. The city could also increase the use of online advertising, newsletters, social media engagement, etc... to spread awareness of important developments.

However, traffic laws are not being enforced and emboldened drivers make the streets unsafe for pedestrians and bicyclists. I can't count the number of times I've almost been struck—sometimes while walking my dog—crossing the street because a driver ignores the red light or stop sign. Let me know if you're interested in some of my personal horror stories.

Dog leash laws are also not enforced, and numerous (and I do mean NUMEROUS) complaints to 311 have done nothing to solve the issue. Delaware Park around the Casino might as well be a dog park, and there are three dog owners (two on Ashland and one on Cleveland) who refuse to put their dogs on a leash. One of them has repeatedly started ""fence fights"" with my dog, has come up on the porch, has tromped through my garden (and we have a stone retaining wall!), etc. Not surprisingly, my girl loses her mind when any of that happens.","I'm not sure this is necessarily the role of city government in terms of ""propping up"" (lack of better way to say it) small businesses. Or any businesses. 

I would however like to see some small beautification grants made available (or, if they already are, make them more well-publicized and with very accessible eligibility requirements). Small businesses are the backbone of retail neighborhoods like Elmwood, Hertel, Allentown, but they don't often have the money to take care of city-planted trees, plant flowers, re-paint their signs, cover graffiti, that kind of thing. Make some small grants available to help them. Even $500 per business would go a LONG way. You could also give some funding to the business associations like Hertel or EVA so they can enhance the efforts they are already making to clean sidewalks and maintain plantings, etc.","Enforce the laws and associated fines that are already on the books. 

Buffalo could make a TON of money just by enforcing the City Code sidewalk shoveling requirements and fines in my neighborhood. You can't walk down Cleveburn, Auburn, or Cleveland safely. Forget even trying it if you're mobility impaired. 

Or you could station a ticket person at the corner of Cleveland and Elmwood and just hand out parking tickets all day. Or hang out at the corner of Auburn and Elmwood near the laundromat. You'd blow any quotas out of the water before noon. And that's before walking through the neighborhood to ticket anyone blocking a driveway, blocking a fire hydrant, parking too close to the corner, parking in a bus stop, or parking on the actual sidewalk. The actual sidewalk, I'm not even kidding. 

I am sure there's more to include along these lines! I think there is a staggering amount of money to be made just doing these two things. Wayyyy more than enough to cover the cost of hiring someone to do them.","If you managed to fund a sidewalk snow removal system of some kind, I would just love you to bits. I don't care if you have to raise my taxes in order to do it. I'll happily pay the increase and even extra to subsidize it for neighborhoods where people can't afford a tax increase. Other snowy cities can manage this. Buffalo should be able to. Even if you just started a pilot program to plow the sidewalks on bus routes so people can safely get to the bus stops. Do something. Anything. I don't see why we can't make this work. There was a photo in the newspaper of a guy with a walker trying to inch his way along the street because the sidewalk was a total disaster.

4/10/2023 12:02:56,Mike and India (Asplundh) ,Yes,"It has improved substantially, but still has a way to go on the Upper West Side. We really appreciate that the police now investigate ""smaller"" crimes, such as burglary and theft. The presence of engaged homeowners with cameras, etc., is also helping considerably. We think that further investment in the CPO program would help a lot too - the retired officers (Christine and Mary Beth) were amazing and that kind of engagement helped clean up key corners because they reached out to landlords and came to block club meetings. We need more city and police support to block clubs and landlords in general. ","No - the city makes licensing for small business difficult. For example, many minor variances require a ZBA submission, sign postings, etc. (e.g., outdoor pop-up market or patio). Also, the existing contractor licensing process is also very ""in house"" and seems to rely on ""who you know"", as the boards are competitors / existing contractors. The city should hire a neutral review board  that grades applications on experience and merit. On the other side of the coin, the city needs to much more aggressively enforce those who operate outside the system in order to support those following the (expensive) rules and processes.  ","The city should seriously consider fee-based services in certain cases - for example, related to snow clearance for all streets. The cost would not be significant to individuals and the saved effort would be a huge help to those with disabilities, elderly, etc. Businesses would also benefit from savings and reduced liability. Buffalo could be known as a city with clear sidewalks, as opposed to people having to walk in the roads. This would also help our national image, tourism, etc. 

We also think that the best way to boost revenue is already in motion - encourage developers to build / renovate in the city. Adding to the tax roll is a massive boost, as the city already has decent infrastructure for double the current density. We need to build more density and support the type of buildings that yield the most ""bang for the buck"", which tend to be the ""taxpayer"" type of development - apartments / condos over commercial space at 3-5 stories. Some good building like this are popping up on Elmwood, Hertel, Jefferson, Grant, etc. Anything to support that, as well as downtown renewal, is a massive boost. 

Another savings is also already in progress - limiting civil service overtime...particularly police and fire. Hiring to full staff in these areas is key. We think there is also a possibility to generate significant income by bringing EMS ""in-house"". Each patient transported allows significant billing by EMS agencies - ranging from low hundreds to well over $1000 per ALS transport. The city could easily cover the costs of a full EMS service....either as it's own agency (such as in Toronto and Hamilton) or integrated with the FD (such as in NYC and Philly). The amount of money paid to the city by AMR is a fraction of billing revenue and EMS should not be ""for profit"" when the city / residents could benefit enormously from the secondary resources provided by a civil service EMS agency (including prevention, wellness checks, health screening, public AED programs, etc.). ","In addition to the items above, the city invests far too little in street maintenance. Most large cities have lines on the roads, streetsweepers, litter vacuum trucks, and sidewalk snowplows. Our public works crews work very hard, but the department needs investment in quality of life work. Lined streets increase pedestrian safety and create a better ""sense of order"". The same is true of litter collection on commercial avenues. 

There is also a need for cats to be included in animal control. There are wild cats all over the upper west side and the city takes no action on this. 

FInally, recreation is almost non-existent. Nearby large Ontario cites and NYC are fine examples of how properly staffed and equipped recreation programs benefit youth, seniors, etc. ",9,9,1,"1 = Roads / Litter, 2 = Parks, 3- Safety, 4- Housing, 5-Education, 6-Environment ","1- youth, 2- health, 3-housing, 4-small business, 5- jobs","1- transit, 2-recycling, 3-energy, 4-green ","1- roads (lines, etc.), 2-transit, 3-water, 4-bridge ","1 - sidewalks (disaster!), 2-transit (terrible!), 3-roads (these are ""ok"") ",Please see above . ,"This survey is a big help, as we can't always go to meetings.

4/10/2023 14:01:10,Colleen Kristich,Yes,"No, I think public safety could be much improved if the city had unarmed community responders to respond to mental health, drug use, homelessness, and other health and social issues. The city should also have a non-police mediation response unit like Dayton, Ohio, to resolve disputes peacefully, violence interrupters to prevent retaliation, and unarmed civilian officers (like Ithaca's) to handle non-urgent, quality-of-life issues. These issues would be better resolved by trained civilian professionals instead of police and other emergency first responders, which would make everyone safer and allow police to focus their time on higher priorities. These efforts could be streamlined if the city established a Community Safety Department, like Albuquerque, Durham, and other cities have done. ","The city could make information about existing small business support more accessible and visible on the website. If the city is not already convening small business leaders and supportive non-profits to collaborate on a regular basis, that might also help. ","The city could apply for more federal and state grants to increase revenue, and could reallocate dollars from the police department and mayor's cabinet to fund new initiatives.

Also the city arts funds should be directed to frontline arts organizations. ","There should be public hearings before the mayor's budget proposal is released. And, Common Council should create and publicize it's own budget proposal and both proposals should be released at the same time, as is done at the state level with one-house Senate and Assembly budgets. That would give Common Council more leverage in making specific, public budget asks and would generate more productive, proactive public discussion. Council hearings are too late in the process to make enough difference. Also public educational workshops on the budget before the budget process begins every year would help residents understand and engage with the process. "

Lets start funding things that work, i.e. community outreach, public works (creating spaces for people to have things to do), after school programs, repairing blighted areas so people feel like their lives have value. Anything but putting more crime chasers on the street.  ","SNOW REMOVAL. We get a lot of snow, somehow, the city under our mayor has forgotten that fact.  Why are we ALWAYS caught behind?  It takes no other city this side this long to get out of a major storm. ",8,8,1,"This is a very poorly designed survey. The only thing on this list worth talking about is Infrastructure, and you leave out a slew of other necessary programs like community outreach, after school programs, job retraining initiatives, incubators, basically anything that would help our community. ",All of these things are a 10/5. Don’t choose between “Do we help people” or “Do we find more crimes?”,All of these things are important. See above. Crime chasers use too much of the city budget. ,"Again, lets cut crime chasers and fund things that help people, like public transportation and water system upgrades (fluoride anyone?)","REMOVE THE SNOW. it’s not this hard. The equipment is a drop in the bucket if we remove a couple of Byron Browns assistants and make him do his own job again. It is crazy that in Rochester, you. get your sidewalks plowed if they get over 4 inches, but somehow Buffalo can’t remember that it snows here. ","The budget spends way to much on chasing crime. If crime were being stopped, I would feel differently. The fact is, the more we spend on chasing crime (SHOCKING) the more crime there is. Lets try and not divide community outreach, infrastructure, and support for businesses.  OVER HALF OUR CURRENT BUDGET GOES TO INEFFECTUAL PROGRAMS THAT THE POLICE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR. Lets put that money into things that help our community. The way this survey was divided shows how poorly our government is working.  ",Start by using social media effectively.

Whether it is the SBA that assists in small business set up, or the City, but it seems that SBA works with small business owners, and yet the business fails.  Unless there is some kind of incubator program that small business owners can tap into for working capital or operations assistance, i do not think the city should take this on.  Working with MWBE's also is helpful, but simply being an MWBE does not guarantee that business will come one's way.  I know some businesses that do not want to go thru the paperwork to get certified mwbe with Empire State.  I think people seriously underestimate what it takes to open a small business, how much working capital is really needed, working with tax dept, health dept, etc, there is a lot of compliance.

I think that there should be a group (not City) people that are small business owners from the entire City of Buffalo that get together and have a space for all of them to come and figure out what they need.  I am sure that there are small businesses that are not aware of what the City can and cannot do.

How about selling some of the property that the City owns to those who will do good by the empty lots.

If we continue to over police petty crimes, we will never get to the root of the problems- basic needs not being met. ","From an infrastructure standpoint, no. We've seen businesses in Allentown close because construction on the road has been ongoing for 2 years, making it impossible to conduct business with little to no pedestrian, bike and car access. In addition, commercial landlords are getting away with major code violations at the expense and detriment of small businesses. Code enforcement should hold commercial landlords financially responsible for infrastructure related code violations that are not the responsibility of the tenant/ small business renting. ","The police budget continues to grow and outsize community resources. Reallocating funds from the police budget to community services like youth programs, affordable housing initiatives, mental health services and other basic needs will eliminate the need for response. This has been proven effective in other cities. Continuing to grow the police budget does not reduce crime or increase quality of life. ","After-school programs are needed to provide our youth with space to gather after school and on the weekends.

Getting feedback after the budget has already been drafted cuts residents out of the process, and allows the status quo to continue.

It's a bit concerning there are so many sex offenders living nearby. There is kind of a high concentration in the two or three block radius here. Maybe the city should make a policy that has a quota on that for each neighborhood. Probably it is an issue about availability of affordable housing. The housing stock in Black Rock is very poor, so a lot of people are basically living in squalor at the mercy of absentee landlords. Fix up the housing and we can attract people who aren't so stressed out. Then also do something to build new or renovate places that lower income people can afford that are not dangerous and depressing to live in. If you read the District D Blotter you can see that most of the crime is domestic issues. More access to counseling resources will help alleviate crime.","I don't know. Probably there could be loans, grants, educational programs, support for getting websites up and running, training young people to be entrepreneurs, featuring small businesses in public events, partnering businesses with investors and mentors. Encouraging larger businesses to include small local businesses in their supply chain, like the way the grocery stores sell farmers market vegetables.","The fines for illegal dumping should not ever be reduced. Make dumpers who are caught pay the full fine.  Most of them don't even live in the city! 

Ticket people for littering and/or not clearing their snow in front of houses and businesses. But first the City should widely announce the expectation and the consequences. Then ease people into it with warnings, then smaller fines, then larger finds for chronic offenders. If somebody would be sent into an economic destress due to such a ticket, find a way to for them to exchange community service hours instead, so they don't have to lose their car or their house or their apartment or their job over a ticket. But people need to start taking more responsibility around here. This could produce revenue, but such revenue should be earmarked towards public education about these issues. People could be given shovels and trash grabbers and gloves along with their garbage cans. This would have to be advertised widely.

Reduction of expenses could be done through increased efficiency in the bureaucracy. You should probably do a wholesale assessment of the different functions and departments and see where things are duplicated or redundant. Also find places where communication is weak. Brainstorm ways to innovate and give departments some incentive and flexibility to refine their processes.

Increase energy efficiency and green energy in City buildings and vehicles.

Perhaps you can do a flex time schedule with some employees... to work full time but work 10 hours over 4 days for example. 

Set up a childcare center for employees working at larger City facilities. They would have to pay, but it would be convenient and could increase productivity.

Sell City of Buffalo ""swag""... tshirts, flags, cups, hats, etc. Have a design contest. Earmark the proceeds for support for the arts or small businesses.

Build a second City Garage in the North District and save gas so plows and service vehicles don't have to drive all the way downtown. This would be good in case of bad storms, too. You could put it on Tonawanda Street near Rano.

Encourage people who have money to invest in homes and move into the city and fix up entire swaths of abandoned neighborhoods, to put those lots on the tax rolls.

Appeal to wealthy athletes to support local initiatives for education and youth activities.





","All of the above! 

Think of ways to integrate all those ideas for more impactful use of public funds. For example, sponsor youth to collaborate with senior citizens using the arts towards improving mental health, fostering community awareness of humane animal treatment, that result in public art installations. 

We also need to prioritize an anti-litter campaign -- which could include public education, youth, adult and senior programs, the arts, etc.  Put money towards a commission that could strategize and implement this.

We have to tackle drinking and smoking epidemics that lead to crime and poor health... and also are sources of chronic litter.

We need so support small (and large) businesses that present an alternative to selling smokes or vapes or liquor. 

We need to change the mindset in this City through education, modeling a different way, and providing opportunities or encourgaging people to create and innovate and be part of the solution.

","The infrastructure, maintenance, hours, and rules for Community Pools should be reassessed and revised.

I want our Community Pool in Riverside Park (for example) to be  much much cleaner. It should also open early and late during the long summer days. People could take a swim before or after work. The sun doesn't set until 9 pm! Have the pool open until at least 8.

People should be allowed to bring in towels and books and sandals and sunscreen and hats and be allowed to hang out and relax and enjoy the space, rather than being told they can't bring anything to the pool and have to sit far away at the bench if they just want to watch their child swim.

Additional, there should be lounge chairs and tables around the pool.

You should put nice Adirondak type chairs in the grass (outside of the pool area)... overlooking the river so people can have a place to sit and watch the incredible sunset.

You could have a business there to sell food and drinks. That would be revenue for the city... or license somebody else to do it.


Beyond that... more should be done to help small businesses and modest to middle income home owners fix up the exteriors of their properties. We need to make this town look nicer and instill more pride of place. This will also bring more people to move in here, to operate businesses here, and to just come and visit and spend money here!","Go on the local news and radio stations and talk about it.

Create informative videos to explain to people the intricacies of the budgeting process including the factors that go into evaluating and setting priorities. Some could be for adults, some for kids, and also for people who speak multiple languages and come from different countries.  

Make sure budget information is available in multiple languages and is accessible to people with disabilities.

Make a curriculum with the Buffalo Public Schools that would engage high school kids to learn about this process.

The budget funds and process should be totally transparent and available in ""real time"" on line. This could be set up as an interesting and engaging website... with some fun elements to also educate people who tune into it. 

There could be parts of the budget that people could vote on. Have a part that KIDS could vote on, in a process through the schools. Even if it is a small symbolic thing to start with.

This habit of theirs makes me uncomfortable to use my park as I worry that doing so will invite suspicion and scrutiny.","The average lifespan of a business opening up on Elwood is abysmal. Hertel is starting down a much similar path. The beautification projects along these main arteries are designed to boost the real estate value of those locations but do little to impact the actual function of those buildings and their commercial value. So small business owners are asked to pay elevated rent without any of the benefits that they are led to believe they'll have from doing so. Real estate speculation and development for its own sake come at the cost of both the tax payers and the cost of operations of small business owners.
Honing in on the infrastructure needs of our commercial districts holds the greatest potential for boosting their long term viability. For instance, I live in the University District portion of Hertel Avenue and while I'm in walking distance of a grocery store, pharmacy and entertainment I hardly take advantage of this fact. The lack of tree cover along the pedestrian walkway means in the scarce months when it is warm enough to walk, the direct sun becomes oppressive and makes the walk too uncomfortable to take advantage of.","Pension reform for Buffalo police officers coupled with attrition to retirement should right size the budget allocated to policing. Taking on spending and saving habits championed by former comptroller Mark Schroeder have a proven track record to boost the city's credit rating, making debt financing cheaper to pursue. Taxes levied on unoccupied housing will deflate the push for gentrification and real estate speculation, will encourage property owners to raise the supply of available housing for both rent and purchase while creating a source of revenue for the city to pursue just housing programs. Sunsetting benefits, incentives and taxbreaks for developers who have failed to meet appropriate goals for community growth will spare the budget from ineffective expenditure.","Investment in the infrastructure on the East Side needs to be a top priority. For too long the lack of spending on the community needs in those districts have exacerbated the segregation that was taken advantage of by the Tops Shooter and has long been sending a message of disinterest in those areas by city hall. The residents on the East Side of Buffalo deserve to feel like they are equally cared about by the city.
Vacants and empty lots should be handed over to the block clubs, land trusts and residents who live in those communities and can better steward those efforts from a community perspective.
Evergreen Health and other healthcare agencies serving Buffalo's most at risk populations are looking down the barrel of a very unfortunate situation regarding state funding and 340b. Healthcare providers ARE the social safety net for an overwhelming number of Buffalonians and coming to the rescue of these orgs will pay long term dividends for citizens here.
Filling in the gap of lifeguard coverage at city pools will be invaluable to citizens and can be done by inviting in (and possibly providing transportation for) candidates from surrounding suburbs while establishing lessons for the next generation of lifeguards so that we can get ahead of long term shortfalls in this population.

4/13/2023 9:21:31,Kevin Heffernan,Yes,"Inadequate. The city is not making a strong enough effort to curb traffic violence, from lack of enforcement of speeding, running through intersections, parking on sidewalks, to continuing road design that encourages speeding, to failing to clear snow from the sidewalks and curbs. In a city where 1 in 4 households doesn't own a car, the city's policies have literally forced people walking into the street with traffic where the data shows they're being hit, injured and killed at alarming rates. Do we care about all of our citizens? Or just the ones with cars?

The city has an advantage over the suburbs in that it hs dense, walkable blocks and relatively strong public transit. But we continue to govern with the same car-first mentality of the suburbs. That's been a losing strategy for over 50 years. Let's start being a city again.","No. The city's small businesses would benefit from walkable neighborhoods, as those who walk or bike to a store or restaurant spend more than those who drive. But the city's policies do not support the walkable neighborhoods we have, nor do they encourage the creation of new ones. Walkable neighborhoods are economically resilient. So by not supporting them, we starve our local businesses. 

Additionally, there was a time when there were very few chain stores restaurants in the city. Now they're everywhere. How do we expect the 3rd poorest city in the country to ever climb out of poverty when we roll out the red carpet for places like Dollar General to vaccuum local money right out of town? 

What is the vision for supporting local businesses? ","Ticket vehicles for parking on the sidewalk. It's happening everywhere and should be a $150 fine because it's a safety issue. 

Convince more manufacturing to open in the city instead of the suburbs or exurbs by promising a ready and skilled workforce can get to work on time and consistently on our dense, walkable, rideable streets. Every firm that opens in the suburbs has to beg NFTA to run a metro line out to them. Why are they not just coming to the city where all the skill levels they need can easily get to work? 

Make it easier to throw major events. The permit system is so hard to navigate when you need to talk to five or six different departments about every line item in your permit. People shouldn't be coming in for 1-2 art festivals and taste of buffalo alone. There should be street-closing events every weekend from May - October. People should come into the city knowing they'll find something they could never do in the suburbs. It will spill over to nearby businesses and make people want to live here. 

The city needs to lean in on its schools. Revenue comes from increasing our residential population, too. SO MANY people love being here in their 20s and then leave for the suburbs for the schools. Can we start touting the success of the high-performing schools, and develop a clear plan of what schools are on the border of being improved, and help facilitate greater parent involvement? City Hall has washed its hands of the schools and their problems for far too long. ","Fund more trash cleanup. Who wants to move into or open shop in a neighborhood that is covered in trash all the time? Are we serious about getting people to invest in the East Side? Then why not have a dedicated crew get out there daily to clean. Help these neighborhoods put their best foot forward, help generate pride in these neighborhoods. Nothing says City Hall continues to forget about us than lawns going weeks without being mowed and trash piling up everywhere. Fund it.

4/13/2023 11:44:02,Joseph Kasperski,Yes,"Yes. My neighborhood is extremely quiet and inviting. Folks are friendly and walkability is high, we don't even lock our doors.","Partially. 

Small businesses struggle with the general conditions of our infrastructure (sidewalks, roads, etc.). This is especially true during snow storms, as major roads are prioritized and potential small business customers are told to stay in their home for a week after a storm because the City refuses to plow residential streets. 

In addition, the City has let many of our staple cultural events leave the last few years. Relocating the Thursday concerts out of Canalside to the Outer Harbor was killer for small business bars and restaurants in Buffalo. I get why, the sponsors preferred it, but the Outer Harbor is drive-in, drive-out and provides no economic support to our City. Same thing with losing the Chicken Wing Festival to Orchard Park, that should never have been allowed to happen. Losing the Bills Stadium deal was bad, but that was a County decision, not much Buffalo could do about that one.

If you want to support small businesses, you need to draw people into the city from the suburbs. It's depressing to see the abandonment walking around downtown these days on a Friday afternoon compared to corporate chains on Maple or Transit Roads. Buffalo should make bringing back our attractions and events a priority. Start by bringing back Canalside (and don't tell me the Fountain Plaza thing is a substitute, we all know it's not even close).

I say partially, because I am not a small business owner and am likely unaware of all the supportive programs and policies the city does have for small businesses. Please keep doing the good. while at the same time make a serious effort to re-energize Buffalo.","Our police department is over-funded. I believe in the need, I believe in public safety, but to see armored personnel carriers rolling through our streets and patrol cruisers equipment with $100k+ equipment to sit in a Wegmans parking lot is overkill. Also, it's arguable that that level of police presence truly reduces crime. I'd prefer a reduction in the police budget in order to fund more community projects, recreation centers, education programs, parks, etc. because that is a more long-term effective method of reducing crime.","BRING BACK THURSDAYS at CANALSIDE! Sorry for shouting, but wow it is so much different downtown now without that concert series. I get it, you want the park to be more family friendly, sponsors prefer the Outer Harbor, and maintenance costs for concerts is high. But I'd like you to reconsider the benefit to our City to have re-occurring major events like that. Thousands of suburbanites were coming into the city every Thursday to attend our events, patronize our bars and restaurants, use our public transit, etc. I think the public safety concerns were overblow and we are missing out on maximizing the return on one of our best public resources.

I personally grew up in Penfield, a suburb on the East Side of Rochester. My friends and I would drive from over an hour away to attend concerts at Thursday in the Square, like Blues Traveler and Edward Sharp and the Magnetic Zeroes. Later, as a UB College Student, I know people that were coming to Buffalo from out-of-state in order to see Salt-N-Pepa, Robert DeLong, Fitz & the Tantrums, etc. These concert goers went out to dinner downtown, stayed in our hotels, went out to brunch the next morning, etc. Yes, traffic was worse, it was loud, families couldn't go to the park, but I thought it was a good balance to at least have those major events once a week. Canalside was the best low-cost outdoor concert venue between New York City and Cleveland and it was a major spur for Buffalo's resurgence. Please bring it back for Buffalo's sake. We have almost entirely lost that and I truly believe it is costing Buffalo in a big, big way.",5,10,3,"1 - Parks & Recreation (bring back Canalside Concerts, get people from the suburbs and surrounding cities (Rochester, Toronto, Cleveland, etc.) to come downtown again...Bringing back those events will help with everything else on this list).

There are a slew of reasons why they don't actually make roads safer: motorists just speed down an adjacent street to make up time (and then those residents will want even more speed bumps), motorists speed between speed humps to makeup time, motorists drive onto yards to avoid speed humps putting pedestrians at risk, etc. Not only that, but speed humps are a maintenance nightmare (think of plowing), are horrible for bicycles (causing more riders to go onto sidewalks and endanger pedestrians), and disrupt response times of emergency vehicles. 

Our roads are in bad enough condition, if there is funding for speed humps then it should be directed towards improving general road conditions.

If you really want to reduce speeding, then please consider asking police to enforce speed limits and other traffic laws. I routinely watch folks speed past police in Buffalo and nothing is done. Writing speeding tickets would boost City funding and make our streets safer, but it seems like police don't like to do it because of the amount of effort. Perhaps provide them incentives to enforce traffic laws? I dunno, to me it's like the easiest part of their job but they don't appear to want to be bothered to do it.",I recommend sending out more flyers/improving website resources to inform residents of Recycling Policies. What can and can't be recycled? Where does our recycling go? Do we have to sort it? Can we put it in bags? Do you recycle everything with a recycling logo on it? I feel the City knows the answers to these questions and could greatly reduce the amount of waste (and costs) and recycling centers if residents simply understood what can be recycled and what can not.

I live two blocks from a school, and on a major East-West bus line, which means kids going to school, pedestrians, and public transit riders have to navigate crossing a busy street without crosswalks. ","I don't have enough information to answer this question well. But, I do think that the City should implement a municipal sidewalk snow removal program for commercial districts, especially those along bus routes, such as on Grant, Elmwood, Hertel, Filmore, Jefferson, Bailey, and Allen. Right now, relying on the property owners to clear sidewalks creates a patchwork of snowbanks, icy sidewalks, and generally poor walking conditions that make it more difficult for people to patronize small businesses across the City for a quarter of the year. While snow removal programs are great for public safety, it's also an economic development initiative. ",I feel very strongly that a land value tax would be an effective tool for increasing revenue for the City in the long term. ,"Sidewalk snow removal. 

Before-school programs for youth, so kids have a place to go if their parents have to go to work before school starts. This would also help with bussing issues. 

Bike infrastructure investment - I work for our regional transportation management association. Over the last year and a half, I've surveyed nearly 3,000 employees at downtown employers about their transportation behavior and preferences. Many employees who live close to work who currently drive to work by themselves said they were either likely or very likely to try biking to work. However, by a large margin, they identified the largest barrier to doing so as inadequate and unsafe bike infrastructure. Protected bike lanes (not painted lanes) should be the number one priority for reducing demand for parking downtown. ",8,8,3,"6 - Public safety (police, fire, EMS)

4/13/2023 17:16:22,Roisin Doherty,Yes,"No, the police are belligerent and instigate conflicts with citizens continually but there’s no enforcement of traffic laws leading to multiple pedestrian and cyclist deaths along with almost weekly car crashes. 

The response time for emergency services is horrible fire and EMT are overwhelmed and BPD can’t be bothered to respond showing up later then first responders even with a massive amount more funding. 

Please increase funding for fire and EMT, create a civilian traffic/parking enforcement group, and increase civilian oversight of BPD to remove continually belligerent and abusive officers. ","No, Allen town HOA has too much power and continually blocks high demand businesses or buildings under the pretext of “preservation and community opposition.” I have not met a single business owner who doesn’t agree that the HOA is abusing its powers in an anti-business, classist, and racist way. It needs to have its power removed or severely diminished. ","Create a a civilian parking and traffic enforcement division to lower the cost per employee of enforcement. Use this decreased employment need to create a civilian oversight committee of BPD to investigate all complaints against officers and allow the community to have justice against the few but severe officers who abuse there power. 

With lowered employment need the city can save on the cost as the removed abusers will be taken off the payroll and the fewer officers, with less responsibilities can spend more time focusing on solving the many unsolved police reports in Buffalo without having to worry about being EMTS and Mental health workers and traffic enforcement. 

Increased snow clearance fine enforcement. 

Increased traffic and parking violation enforcement and traffic camera ticketing.

","There should be increased funding for transit and snow clearing programs.

NFTA is currently having challenges hiring workers, but with 30% of Buffalo not owning a car, they can only hire from the 70% who have a license. There should be funding allocated to NFTA to increase frequency and cover the cost of a drivers license AND CDL for eligible applicants without a license. This will allow for better transit and increased economic prosperity as the 30% without a car are often limited in job opportunities do to the difficulty in accessing jobs with infrequent transit. 

Buffalo should create funding for sidewalk and bike lane snow clearing. Most businesses are not clearing the snow or maintaining sidewalks and almost no private residence makes an attempt at this. Buffalo has a 30% population with no access to a car and therefore 30% of the city is stuck in extremely unsafe conditions for the winter. Many disabled people rely on sidewalks and bike lanes to access transit and businesses as cars are inherently not designed with disabilities in mind.

Bike lane clearing and salting along with strategic sidewalk clearing and salting, paired with increased fines and enforcement of fines for businesses and properties who do not clear and salt sidewalks to meet ADA standards should be able to easily fund a large portion of the snow clearing. With increasingly mild winters, having cleared pedestrian infrastructure will allow for increased commerce and sales tax revenue as people feel more comfortable navigating the city outside of a car. 

Also Buffalo sanitation department/DPW deserves a significant increase in funding to help with clearing of trash and increased street/bike lane sweeping and maintenance. This is on top of the fact that sanitation is always ranked in the top 10 most dangerous jobs significantly higher then police and even beating Fire and EMT almost every year.

4/13/2023 19:41:45,Rebecca ,Yes,"** How do you define public safety here?  For me, it includes dismantling the police force entirely because they have proven time and again they aren’t here for our safety or crimes against us but rather to protect property of rich people and literally make every situation worse. It means providing accessible access to resources residents need to feel safe like healthcare, housing, food, education, and NEVER giving people who only want to spread hate, violence, and misinformation a public forum. It means that I don’t have to be afraid of walking to the bus stop in bad weather because the busses run so infrequently, they are very few shelters with no upkeep, not having to climb mountains of unshoveled snow and not constantly falling on ice. It means not punishing people who are homeless with hostile architecture. It means having proper warning of inclement weather that includes banning employers from forcing employees to stay during blizzards or even worse, to travel at all. It means not having to live on $25 of food stamps a month, because, hey, that’s me rn and I am welllll below the poverty level. It means nfta not leaving people stranded constantly due to breakdowns. It means the people of Buffalo don’t feel as though they are more likely to die from being murdered by police or frozen to death than from any other cause. It means more green spaces and sustainable development and holding politicians accountable for not representing their constituents and holding corporations accountable when the pollute our beautiful land and water or don’t fulfill promises they made to get deals from the city. It means treating covid and especially the accessibility problems it has exacerbated with the respect deserved and instituting and enforcing masking and air filtration requirements for all public spaces and businesses. Wanna help small businesses?  Why not help them get those filtration systems?",Of course it’s not. How about you tell us what you actually think you’re doing to help,Gut the entire police budget and somehow I don’t think you won’t worry about finding revenue. ,"All of those are great. Also, how about actually preparing for bad weather instead of reacting after the fact while keeping sidewalks and bus stops accessible at all times. ",1,1,1,"First, your examples of what you imagine as public safety should never include people who carry weapons. Also that section is least important. (6)

Because you keep giving most of the budget to your twisted idea of safety, all of the rest of the options are so neglected it’s embarrassing at best and ACTUALLY LIFE THREATENING on a daily basis. So ALL of the remaining five should be your #1 priority. ","Once again, all of these have been neglected and gutted for so long that all of these should be your #1 priority. 

1. Affordable and sustainable housing that actually happens bc how many never seem to come to fruition?
2. Healthcare and mental health services that DO NOT INCLUDE POLICE. Stop perpetuating the sponsored murder of innocent people and children. 
3. Small businesses support. 
4. Youth programs esp with arts 
5. Job training. ","Buffalo is considered to be a haven for climate change refugees and this is only increasing with the progression of environmental catastrophe.   Since almost all the good things happening in ALL of your listed categories have had to happen through grassroots efforts and volunteers, Buffalo has a lot to catch up with as most of Buffalo’s efforts have been to cut and neglect all of these. Looking for money?  Try the police budget. 

Take a look at cities doing this right—there are many. And then make every single one of these high priority. Without kickbacks. ","If you hadn’t stripped and neglected all of these, but you did. And now they’re all beyond critical to public safety. Eliminate police and make all of these a priority ",Here’s the thing. All of those things need done. Not negotiable. There is no lowest priority to this because this is how you keep people alive and safe. Stop giving kickbacks to individuals and businesses that nearly unilaterally ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH BUFFALO SNOW. We’re Buffalo!  Why the heck do we not have this together??,Dismantle the police and use that insane amount of money to actually help people become and stay safe. ,Schedule your meetings for when most citizens can actually make it.

Tossing more money into improving our road snow removal clearly generates no significant positive outcomes over the current level of spending. When you do not clear sidewalks or public transit many people are forced to walk in the now narrow and more dangerous roads because the sidewalks are impassable.

4/14/2023 10:27:45,Liam Winters ,Yes,"Not even close. There are no protected bike lanes anywhere. There is very little traffic calming in residential streets, allowing drivers to speed past children playing outside without concern. Snow removal for cyclists and pedestrians is non-existent, forcing people to walk in the road with cars. ","Build secure bike parking near small businesses. Cyclists spend more money at small businesses than motorists do, because it's easier to stop and window shop on a bike. A lack of secure bike parking deters people from biking when they might otherwise want to. ","Build protected bike lanes. They have some upfront cost, but over the course of their lifespan, biking infrastructure costs 10 to 20X less than infrastructure for cars. Roads and highways wear themselves out and need to be continually resurfaced every few years. Cycle tracks and bike lanes wear out at a much slower rate due to much less weight being put on their surface. Ove their lifespan, they will offer huge financial savings versus building only roads for cars.

Despite our best efforts, the city is not taking steps to redesign our streets and traffic patterns, and the best we get are small speed humps which are a band-aid solution which hardly works at all. We also need traffic enforcement back in hotspot ares where the majority of drivers are comfortable breaking traffic laws and endangering everyone around them.","No. You can sit down with mega-landlords like Mike Miranda who has a monopoly on properties on Main St in University Heights and charges obscene rents, doesn't care if businesses fail, and therefore all we have are smoke shops, convenience stores, and abandoned storefronts which are all bad for our community and setting it back. The city FINALLY took serious action on the Cobblestone buildings, and they should consider other drastic measures when it comes to large developers and property owners who create blight through their action and inaction.","Stop bullshit arrangements with for-profit institutions like traffic camera companies, developers, and absentee slumlords. Start heavily fining drivers for dangerous traffic infringements on residential streets, start heavily fining nuisance student renters which repeat violations, start heavily fining absentee landlords who let their properties rot while still renting to unsuspecting families and students, create regulations that punish landlords who profit off of tenants opening illegal businesses without special use permits and who price gouge on rent because they have a local monopoly, start fining industrial sites which illegally noise pollute and harm the surrounding community... there are so many things, but you need to start holding those in power accountable...

Better streetscapes and services would be a good place to focus some energy. ,"These are some of the top ways city get revenue: 1) user charges, 2) property taxes, 3) intergovernmental aid from the state, and 4) sales and use taxes. I’d be fine with modest increase in 1, 2, and 4 if it came with a good plan to actually improve some of the things I’m mentioning in this survey. But I also realize Buffalo is a pour city some that has to be balanced with a well thought out long term vision. Currently I don’t know what the vision is. It’s not clear to me. I see a lot of the stuff that’s been improved done by citizens, local groups and an influx of cash from various external resources (state, feds, Ralph Wilson foundation, etc.) . ","All of those are good but again let’s start with the basics. Clean streets, plan more trees, pedestrian lighting, snow removal on sidewalks, better bike infrastructure, and public transportation. More pocket parks and green spaces throughout the city. Instead of building on every lot let’s save a few for pocket parks. I tried to do this multiple times and got denied purchase unless I had building plans. Short side thinking. Regarding the next question the things I mentioned improve everyone’s living standards. Equally important is education. Better schools! ",8,7,3,"All 6s and need work: Streets and public transportation, Parks and green spaces (including more trees), Education.

But I would prioritize youth development along with education. While we are on that providing healthy food for kids at school is important. ,"4 - green infrastructure and healthy communities is also more trees and green spaces. Next public transportation that is reliable is important. But also creating walkable, bike friendly areas that have access to all the services is great. I’m not sure how well the city of Buffalo does in areas like renewables. Better recycling and waste reduction is great but not on the top of the list.  ",4 - again focus on public transportation. City is already spending over $200m on water and sewer but needs to be considered in long term planning…roads and bridges are important but this is also a lot of state/fed money. ,"3 - transit stops, side walks and bike lanes are the priority.

4/14/2023 14:26:20,Gloria Mandravelis ,Yes,"No, it's dangerous in the winter to have to use NFTA buses. If the homeowners or businesses pays to have their driveway plowed, usually the packed snow blocks the sidewalks or crosswalks. The ADA sidewalk cutouts are lower than the surrounding pavement, water pools and freezes. My waterproof boots are no match for the amount of water. In winter, I walk on the road where there is the least amount of snow or ice. I am a senior citizen and my balance is poor on uneven ground. My knees are stiff, I can't navigate  mounds of snow and ice that plague city sidewalks and bus stops. There is a lot of litter, and I am constantly looking down so I don't slip on a bottle. Please plow the sidewalks with clear access to the crosswalks and bus stops/shelters. The city plows leave intersections with mounds of packed snow and ice at crosswalks. I am frightened waiting in the street for the bus at Grant and W. Ferry, on the weekends the bus run every 40 to 45 minutes. This allows too many opportunities for a distracted, drunk,  high or oblivious car or truck drivers to hit me.","No, let them know what resources are available, some of the small businesses on Grant Street owned by immigrants need a face lift. The same businesses are getting grants, when other businesses here need help and seem unaware of the grants.","Get rid of the dead weight, if they can't do a competent job, place them on probation or fire them. Fine the commercial plow drivers who block sidewalks with their plowing.","Can tiny houses be built for the homeless? Allow the vocational students in area schools a chance to plan and build them.

4/15/2023 9:29:08,CS Hunters,Yes,"No. First, we all recognize that there isn't enough money to allocate for everything - but public safety should be a top priority as its a foundational piece to a thriving and growing city.  One thought is to make building and creating new Block Clubs in the City to help with neighborhood revitalization.  Look for Federal Block Grants with  focus on staffing a position or two in City Hall to build, and train block clubs AND to fund work for their projects.  Work to establish neighborhood watch groups with a system to report problems to a dispatcher - real time and not use the 911 system.  Focus on getting a pilot project going.  One area could be the Broadway-Fillmore neighborhood based on the amount of money being put into it by the State and City.","No, its not.  A couple of thoughts here.  First, the city needs to have a targeted plan that's understood and accessible.  Communications to city residents, businesses, and organization is pitiful, and more often than not, last minute.  This needs to be fixed.

Work with local TV and Radio outlets to run 20 second Public Service Announcements for free with focus on dumping, and one on cleaning up debris, and garbage in from of homes and businesses.  Also, do one on beautification. All of this will help make the city better and will help businesses.

Also, look for ways to get rusted accordion gates and rolldown gates for storefronts - it leaves the impression that streets are not safe.  Look to products like Riot Glass that can be retrofitted on top of existing windows. 

Lastly, Look for way to develop neighborhood business associations for a common purpose - to increase streetscapes, storefronts, reduce crime, and get hid of hand painted and plastic signs.  ","Look at vacant properties and give them away in homesteading programs.  Take the money the City spends on demos and give grants for roofs/windows to any homesteader with a viable 5 year plan to renovate the property and live in it.

Also, figure out a way to put teeth into the Housing Court - its ineffective - has been for years.  It needs new leadership and judges.  Start fining and collecting. 

Putting vacant land and buildings to a better use will increase the tax base.

Lastly, modernize City Hall processes. Obtain software to create workflows for forms, so people can follow where the request is in the process. 

Look for ways to reduce hassle - paperwork, processes.... we live in an electronic world - use it.  It will take money to reduce costs.","Youth programming - Public/Private partnerships.  Ask Corporations to adopt a program to help with costs and/or mentorship.

Get a rodent program that works.

Fund Block Clubs and get Business Associations going.

Fund sidewalk and bus stop snow clearing.

These options only lead to one conclusion - which is the only order I stated.  Roads need to be cleared and salted for commerce, work travel, and general public safety - medical emergencies.  Then you force us to pick between sidewalks and bus stops - Well you can't easily get to a bus stop if the sidewalks are not cleared. So you're left with this order of things.  Run a pilot for clearing sidewalks and bus stops on main road. Pick 3-4 in each area of the city or on frequent bus routes.  Many, many cities are clearing sidewalks.  Figure out a way to fund part of that removal by levying a ""services tax"" on businesses.  See how Amherst, Rochester, and Syracuse is doing it.   In my world, as with many others - all services above are #1. ","Fund Block Clubs with cleanup/beautification/neighborhood watch groups with Fed Block grant money.  

Ditto with Business Associations.  This is not rocket science for political will and a little bit of elbow grease.  Leadership rolls up its sleeves.

No need to fund programming for inclusion, etc.... the ""weight"" of these topics in the public's consciousness will carry those valued needs though programming on its own. ","Communication by municipalities is poor all over the place: City, County, and State. It's hard to engage the community when hearings are during the working day, and items that residents travel to city hall to speak about are tabled during the meeting - leaving folks hanging and wasting their time and energy.  All meetings should be streamed and allow for people to post questions and/or speak for an allotted minute or so.

I have an idea but it requires funding."

These are the most affluent. Allentown is there too. But not so much for shopping. More for eating. Being a pedestrian is unsafe in buffalo. The city should put more effort in keeping sidewalks clear and accessible, traffic calming measures, ticketing for speeding and running red lights, trees to shade sidewalks and benches to relax or wait for busses. Why are there any four lane roads in a 30 mph zone? Bailey is particularly dangerous. In the white part of town there are lines on the road and traffic signal but it's still treated like a highway. In the black part of town there is no traffic markers of any kind and it's a free for all with excessive speed. The whole street should be narrowed, marked, and repaved.

Lastly, require an extra driver safety course for insurance in Buffalo but it should be free. Buffalo drivers are very reckless.

Oh! And track down DUIs.","First and foremost stop giving tax breaks to rich developers and not charging late fees to scum like sanatra who exploit the residents of buffalo and then say they can't pay their taxes!!! The mayor and his cronies should be ashamed! Small business folks can do a better job at revitalizing it than the jemals and sanatra. Consider development collaborative. Where many small business owners work together to own and operate larger buildings/property and then they will pay their taxes on time and in full. And then something related to sportsball. Buffalo folks are nuts about sportsball any people come from all over to see it. There has got to be any easy money making opportunity there. The suburbs send sewage to our treatment plant. Charge the suburbs a higher price. Also trackdown sewage overflows from upstream sewers and take them to court.

2) Pay citizens to clear sidewalks in the areas they live by. I, for example, have a snow blower and have voluntarily snow blown two square blocks near us to promote the safety of pedestrians who are often seen walking in the road when I don’t do it.

4) increase funding for our libraries to provide safe spaces for the growing number of kids that are homeschooling. And provide counseling/support for parents struggling with homeschooling paperwork.

2) job training that includes positions for city residence to do city work, Beard, trash, removal, sidewalk, maintenance, landscaping, traffic, signal, maintenance, etc. etc. We are a big enough city. We don’t need to outsource everything. We can find ways to keep people making the city better, when all of our traffic signals are functioning, for example.

","1) make a public transit, a viable alternative to owning a car for people with busy schedules. Get rid of the advertising on the buses that makes people feel like they are transportation Has to be subsidized by greedy lawyers.

If I didn’t have a car I’d essentially be limited to job opportunities within walking distance.

","There’s a lot of organizations and groups within Buffalo that support the outdoors, and it’s proven that connection with the outdoors starting at a young age has so many lasting, lifelong benefits. I think the city connecting with these orgs and funding after school or summer programs for kids to learn about the outdoors and wildlife, (ex. birding is something that can be done in urban and rural environments) getting them to care about our environment, would go a long way in improving the mental health of Buffalo youth as well as changing the face of outdoor community with young, diverse, and educated people getting involved in positive ways.

Strategies for balancing the budget
MIKE MUCHA
MAY 25, 2020
As county governments begin to address large revenue shortfalls and significant gaps in their budgets, commissioners, executives, finance and budget staff and leaders from across every department in your organization will need to work together to consider both the short and long-term implications of budget reduction strategies.  

GFOA has developed a 12-step guide to financial recovery as part of our overall fiscal first aid resources (available online at www.gfoa.org/ffa). These resources recognize the various stages of financial distress and highlight potential treatments that county governments can take. However, these treatments are not without risk. In solving the immediate budget crisis, leaders must make sure they also don’t jeopardize their long-term financial stability or hurt the prospects for financial recovery.

In early March, when the pandemic first caused shutdown orders and forced many to work from home, governments had to take short-term action to reduce spending, manage cash flow and identify how to maintain critical operations. As the economy starts to re-open, and as governments begin to grasp both the depth and longevity of this financial crisis, more severe budget-balancing strategies will be necessary. 

Not every government will be in the same situation, however. With county governments getting revenue from a mixture of different sources and with the different level of impact that COVID-19 has had on different locations, the required severity of budget treatments will differ. This article highlights several common fiscal first aid treatments and the risks to consider for each. Treatments are categorized by type but are presented in no particular order. GFOA also understands that every local government may have unique risk factors or situations in your community to address so there is no one-size-fits-all approach to budget balancing.

PERSONNEL COSTS 
For many governments, personnel costs can make up 70 percent or more of total expenses, so any discussion about closing a large budget shortfall must include salary cost savings. Governments, however, can use different strategies such as freezing vacant positions, better managing overtime or address health care costs before considering more severe measures like wage freezes, hiring freezes, reduction in hours or ultimately layoffs. 

Caution: With riskier approaches (furloughs, hiring freeze or wage freeze), governments risk driving away their more talented staff. The broad nature of these programs often results in productivity losses greater than cost savings, large drop in employee morale and tendency for staff to begin sacrificing organizational goals for personal or department gains.

PURCHASING PRACTICES 
Vendors and suppliers present another opportunity for savings. Governments can use this opportunity to renegotiate or rebid contracts, audit routine purchases, or eliminate non-essential contracts. However, the largest improvement that governments can make with purchasing practice is to strictly adhere to policy. Many governments have purchasing policies that require use of purchase orders, competitive bids or board approval. By routing all transactions through a purchasing process, spending can be tracked and staff can receive timely information to monitor the current budget situation. In times of financial crisis, it is essential that managers have current and accurate information for budget monitoring.

Caution: Purchasing policies that require approvals should not overburden transactions with unnecessary approvals. Managers must be allowed to manage and putting unreasonable approval processes in place for all transactions will only increase the costs of operations.

ASSET MANAGEMENT 
Capital projects and large asset or equipment purchases (including software) can present opportunities for savings and are likely very visible examples of current spending. Strategies like extending the useful life of assets, deferring maintenance or postponing projects can provide savings opportunities. 

Caution: In the short term, these strategies can provide relief, but as a long-term option, they present significant risks. Extending asset beyond its useful life or deferring maintenance can lead to higher long-term costs or drop in service level from non-functioning equipment.  In addition, delayed projects may also delay opportunities for efficiency gains (for example from software modernization efforts).

SHARING RESOURCES 
Governments have a tendency to operate as a collection of siloed departments. Significant saving opportunities can come from sharing more resources and greater collaboration. For example, unused equipment can be transferred to another department, inventory can be jointly managed or staff can transition to assist with peak work periods. In addition, governments may find opportunities to partner with other governments, non-profits or private organizations. For example, governments can work to borrow large equipment from neighboring jurisdictions rather than purchasing the asset or pursue managed competition opportunities for common services.

Caution: Turning over control to another entity or becoming dependent on another organization to provide services adds risk for service delivery. Governments should make sure to work on proper service level agreements or MOUs when sharing resources.

REVENUE ENHANCEMENT
For most counties, the primary cause of the financial crisis will be loss of revenue, not out of control expenses. While actions geared to increasing revenue may be more difficult, options do exist. Governments can work to ensure any federal or state aid that they are eligible for is claimed. Often, these programs have complex requirements and limits. Understanding these rules is important for compliance. Governments may also have opportunities to explore new options for increasing fee revenue or examine and improve existing billing and collection procedures.

Caution: More aggressive bill collection policies should be evaluated with larger community goals in mind. The collection methods used in the private sector may not treat constituents in a way that reflects well on government, especially during an economic downturn when many people are vulnerable","Yes arts & cultural events, animal control services and adoption, and better access during winter for sidewalks and bus stops.

Murders take place and we hear nothing after the initial news blurb. Car thefts are rampant. Drivers are frequently unhinged and dangerous. We need cops walking/biking and not just doing occasional drive-bys.,Not informed on this issue.,City Hall is widely considered to be unresponsive and inept. An example is the Love Your Block grant. We applied and kept inquiring and never got a response. We heard no one was chosen for it last year. This is just one example. City Hall needs to be better managed which could cut costs.,"An issue important to me as a resident of the east side is vacant lot management and trash clean-up. The City has been downright difficult in allowing residents and Grassroots Gardens to create food gardens to feed the neighbors. The pushback from the City seems to be based on the $$ they can make selling the lots for development. There are SO many empty lots that are eyesores that can be better put to use. Taking care of public-facing spaces like community gardens and the value it brings to neighborhoods is sadly overlooked. The trash all over the east side is a disgrace. Yes, the residents themselves created it but many of us regularly clean up our streets and would like to see more done by the City. Another issue is the Zombie homes everywhere. Crack down on the slumlords. Lastly during the blizzard, plows tore up huge chunks of grass and storms drains and curbs then never came back to fix them. Sidewalks on the east side are another issue. They are non-existent in places or in poor repair. Why are sidewalks in South Buffalo perfect but not the east side? And don't get me started on potholes. The disparities are glaring.

I would love to see a refresh of zoning laws, a push to remove surface lots downtown and replace them with mixed-use development, diversity ordinances, working with local banks to provide more access to capital, and and ACTUALLY prioritizing walkable communities. With the abhorrent snow removal alone, it's clear Buffalo does not care about creating vibrant, accessible, and walkable neighborhoods.  ","There are a few things that could help. Buffalo has fallen behind similar cities like Cleveland and Pittsburgh partially due to lack of anchor Fortune 500 companies who hire a large number of workers. Small businesses are the backbone of the economy, but it takes a lot of other components to keep a city standing. Pushing to further incentivize larger corporations to set up shop here would help keep people in town with higher paying jobs, living in the city, and give small businesses an opportunity to reap the benefits. The city would reap the tax benefits too. That would lead to more diversity with owners, residents, and options. ","There's a severe lack of third places in Buffalo for young kids to go. After-school programs that are aligned with the current needs of youth would be extremely beneficial. Too many programs are outdated and no longer relevant to kids in school right now.

I've lived on this street 15yrs and cannot understand the lack of investment and depth of the neglect in my neighborhood.

It's like you expect the citizens to do the litter pickups, beautification, door to door checkins on elderly, the repairs so folks can age in place, the upkeep of the vacant lots, and chainsawing huge dead branches ON OUR OWN--without working with us or offering support. There needs to be more small spaces available for folks to use to manufacture or grow their business alongside businesses at that level. More room for pop-ups, more workshops about the stepping stones. More promotion of LOCAL everything.

I have heard of so many small businesses, especially restaurants that can not stay in business because of high rents. What is the city doing to help prevent this?","Ticket people who drive unsafely, (speed, run lights, pass cars on city streets). This would improve safety. I also think small raises in taxes would be fine, if they were coupled with using technology to make things more efficient. ","Arts and cultural seem key, especially to make sure they are well distributed through all of Buffalo. I want to see cleaner streets. No one should have garbage on their streets. There needs to be more spent on mental health as a way to minimize police having to take mental health calls.",2,2,2,"All of them! And I don't think you have to rank them. More, I think the key is to think about in each of these areas what are the programs that will have the most impact. Some might be more expensive, and others less, but if they are going to work in the long run, they are worth it.","The Buffalo Public Schools must be part of this solution. If young people are leaving school without the skills to be hired, then that has to be looked at too. Again, all of these are important. The goal is to find the best programs, and fund those. What are other cities that have similar demographics to buffalo having success with? Let's study what is known to work, and then bring it here. And also, you need excellence in leadership. An amazing program will not be amazing if it doesn't have good people leading it. How are we ensuring that the best and the brightest are leading these programs?","Again, what are the best programs. What will have the biggest impact? What do the scientists say? Follow their research. A lay person may have a feeling, but we need to choose what will have the biggest impact.","Again, what are the most urgent needs from a health and infrastructure perspective. Do those.","Again, all three seem important. I don't see why one is more important than the others.","I think financial stability is key. What ways are we spending money now, that will lead to a stronger city economy? What are businesses saying about what the conditions are like in Buffalo? I think integrating the economy and services also seems important. How are we looking at climate change, education and business as interconnected. What are we doing to help newcomers to Buffalo, so that they can thrive?","I think this survey is a great start. However, I wonder if this is the best use of citizens' input. I have heard before that the best way to get citizen input is before things like this are put together, not after. Are you collecting specific feedback about these different elements along the way? That might be useful. So a survey just about snow removal, or about the condition of streets etc."

ESPECIALLY do not build the proposed new holding center when there are unaddressed human rights violations coming out of the one that currently terrorizes Erie county.,"buffalo public schools desperately need more funding. we also need to change out our combined sewage-stormwater system at some point, that can't be put off indefinitely or else our city will just keep declining and become outdated entirely. we are especially doomed if we need to close the downtown library, just an utter failure of a city.",7,8,7,"1-education. 2-housing and community development. 3-infrastructure. 4-environmental sustainability. 5-parks and recreation. 6-public safety. assuming attention from the budget means to give more money to these areas. they all need equal consideration in how to address the issues, which funding alone can never fix.","1-affordable housing initiatives. 2-job training and workforce development programs. 3-healthcare and mental health services. 4-youth development programs. 5-youth development programs. 5-small business support programs. the order this was listed matches my priorities exactly. healthcare starts with housing and stable income. proper youth development prevents decline of mental health. it should concern us the least to be preoccupied with how we spend our money would negatively impact us, but it would always be better to see that money get distributed amongst working class community members and not large corporations that bleed our community dry of funding and the taxes we pay for them to operate never come back to us.","1-recycling and waste reduction programs. 2-public transportation improvements. 3-green infrastructure projects. 4-renewable energy initiatives. our landfills are severely mismanaged across the country and we are never told by authority figures the right way to dispose of anything. this could be something we champion and hold manufacturers accountable for in the form of taxes. we need a real rail system here and that would boost the economy for decades, a never-ending return in revenue would come from it, especially as the world phases out gas and the culture of single-use vehicles. if we cannot pull that off here, people will simply leave and go somewhere else, many already have. in a city with very old buildings, we would benefit from the protection of green roofs and rain gardens, it would mitigate so many repairs and and stifle the rate of decay. beyond what the state and country mandates, we should not need extra initiates for implementing renewable energy, we are already an ideal place to climate change refugees because of its unique continental conditions. it is enough to know that the switch may save the planet and not switching will be the cause of ruin to the city. we need to accommodate building up the city to great heights.",1-water and sewer system upgrades. 2-public transportation improvements. 3-road. 4-bridge.,1-plowing and salting. 2-removal from public transit stops. 3-removal from sidewalks. removal should be more of a focus going forward.,i think i've said enough.,"more town hall meetings that don't arbitrarily get shut down when a valid critique is presented. better communication with residents would infer our opinions actually influence policy. disengagement of the public is directly related to how much you ignore us. assuming you want this to be a real democratic participatory process, and in the interest of saving paper, you should email or text residents access to budget information as soon as it is proposed and communicate dates when opinions need to be submitted and PLENTY of time in advanced to alert us of a meeting, as is legal."

I feel the resources could be better used. Where were they during the blizzard I was stuck in an area they ""stalk"" regularly for 8 hours, not 1, not a single 1 passed us by. ","I don't have an opinion as far as small business, what I say is I feel there is a influx of small business owned by Arabic, Bengalese and other eastern European descent folx with no investment into black owned small business. It is twice sometimes thrice as hard for those owners to get the grants, the loans, the investment than the non-american born citizens. ","Allocate the funds for our neighborhoods by investing in community centers, fixing pot holes that have been in existence since I was a child, more homeless shelters and shelters that are equipped to handle the influx that WILL COME WITH OUR NEXT WINTER. Invest in city parks and training programs for young. Give them something to do, give them a responsibility without limitation on who and why they can receive it. Start a paid internship program to help keep parks clean and safe. Work with PAL to help fund there community programs that go around to different community parks and provide sports equipment and activities for children. They are 1 association and they have a packed schedule yearly fund other partner organizations that can help carry the load to ensure our children can have a safe, lucrative, enjoyable summer. Fund life guards and community action groups to secure city pools. The solution is not always have cop cars patrol, enact citizen policing some kind of way .

These are key to environmental resilience: how do we integrate the next million immigrants we get from Africa, Central America, and, by the end of the century, Florida?  Do we provide safe and welcoming space for them, or do we resign ourselves to a rising homeless population, as we have seen happening in California in the wake of wildfires?

1-Public Safety (esp Police) - I tell you what is scary and what might really hurt the city is the throngs of poorly behaved mostly teenagers coming out of the schools or meeting up in large groups and causing havoc that happened recently at University Plaza (though in Amherst technically) - these situations need to be anticipated more by police etc and broken up before they can gain momentum - scanning social media, etc. And never utter the ""Defund the Police"" slogan it sends people into a panic - police reforms - sure and always, but never defund. Also the crazy unregistered bikes and atv groups cause terror in the city.  It's unacceptable and intimidating as they circle around people and cars, and will drive people and investment away.  Also stealing is getting out of control along with the looting like with last blizzard.  Now you see Rite Aid closing two stores that were looted - actions have consequences.  And of COURSE the Tops shooting - not sure if it could be prevented 100% but god I hope nothing like that happens again in the city it was so tragic and I feel for the Afircan American community especially. Lastly crime in general - as bad as ""targeted crime is"" and I mean gangs and drugs or domestic where they know each other, its the random acts of violence such at the Tops shooting or big groups intimidating or shooting anything in site that will terrify all of the citizens and do so the most.

2-Infrastructure - see above. I do think it's improved in recent years but needs to be ratcheted up.

3-Parks and Rec - MAINTAIN what we have.

4-Education - It seems to be worse than ever.  We need excellence and to lift all boats

Also ""off hours"" budget and ""town hall"" meetings (evenings, weekends).  I do think a fair amount is provided you just have to seek it out and be an informed citizen.

Too often things are swayed by a small amount of people and groups who solely exist to work over government to try and get what they want and claim they're ""non-profit"" or ""for the people"" but are a small fraction with an outsized influence.  We can't all come to city hall all week to ""protest"". I believe there are lots of individuals that aren't being heard and it isn't those who claim they aren't on tv and elsewhere.  The common person is often left behind or forgotten about. The past mayoral election will show you how many ""silent"" voices came out to vote against a candidate that scared a lot of people and acted like a majority wanted such an extreme agenda."
